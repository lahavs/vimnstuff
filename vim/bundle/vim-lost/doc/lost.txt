INTRODUCTION                                    *lost*

Lost provides a single command, |lost-:Lost|, to help you orient yourself in
large sections of code.

Context                                         *lost-context*

Lost borrows the concept of the C function from `diff(1)`, which `git(1)` uses
to give context by default.  I am astounded, after using `git(1)` as long as I
have, how often the "C function" works for almost every single bit of code
I've ever written.  I hope it works just as well for you!


COMMANDS                                        *lost-commands*

                                                *lost-:Lost*
:Lost                   |:echom| the |lost-context| of the current line.

FUNCTIONS                                       *lost-functions*

                                                *lost-Lost_string()*
Lost_string()           returns the |lost-context| of the current line.

MAPPINGS                                        *lost-mappings*

                                                *lost-gL*
gL                      call |lost-:Lost|

SETTINGS                                        *lost-settings*

                                                *lost-regex*

If you work in a language that does not typically work with this venerable
heuristic, you can tweak it by setting `b:lost_regex`.  For markdown, to match
titles, I did the following in my vimrc:

      augroup vimrc
        autocmd!

        au FileType markdown let b:lost_regex = '\v^#'
      augroup END

                                                *lost-statusline*

If you want to see your context directly in your statusline, you can use
something like this:

      %{strpart(Lost_string(), 0, 20)}

Any expression using |lost-Lost_string()| should work; though I'd recommend
using |strpart()| if only to avoid overlong status lines.
